Two of his siblings are still studying and one of his brother is already a seaman. His parents are both business owners. When it comes to education, he studied his primary education at Pangpang Elementary School then secondary at Sorsogon National High School. Currently, he is a second year student taking up criminology with a main goal of addressing crime, victimization, and the relationship between governmental agendas and knowledge production. Although this is a challenging course, He is doing his best to pursue his dream of being a police officer. He is doing this not just for himself and family, but for the whole society as a whole. In terms of hobbies, he like to play a guitar and other musical instruments. Also, singing is one of his talents. Not necessarily joining in competitions but in some occasions and celebrations, he does the singing. While studying criminology, he join clubs such as taekwondo club. This is to balance study and non-curricular activities which is essential not just mentally, but physically and socially as well. he also does board games, especially if it’s holiday, and all members of the family are at home. This is a great game for bonding with the family. For social relationships, he is a family person, with a lot of friends, mentors etc. Every Sunday, he and his family go to church. For him, of all kinds of relationship, relationship with God is the most important. On the other hand, after God, family comes next. In case of hardships and obstacles, they are always there, hand in hand to accompany him. He is grateful that they are his family. In terms of personal growth, he can say that he is much stronger than who he was before. The challenges he faced and encountered made him the man he is today. He believe, human beings should experience such things as these are essential for growth and development of human. Without these, we can’t be human. As a student, He advocates mental health awareness. This is very timely as most of people experiencing this are teenagers. A lot of people say that current generation thinks differently compared to earlier generation. He can attest to that. He just like to emphasize that, no matter what the circumstances are, just always spread kindness for we don’t know what problem they are currently facing. With that, we won’t add up to their burden. Just being considerate to others is enough. ..

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's words, ideas, or intellectual work without proper acknowledgment or authorization, presenting them as your own. It can occur in various forms, such as directly copying text without citation, paraphrasing someone else's ideas without giving credit, or failing to attribute the source of information or data used in a piece of writing. In academic and professional settings, plagiarism is considered unethical and a serious violation of intellectual property rights. It undermines the original creator's efforts and damages the credibility of the person committing it. Plagiarism can be intentional, such as deliberately copying entire sections of a published work, or unintentional, which often happens due to a lack of understanding of proper citation practices or carelessness in research. Regardless of intent, plagiarism has consequences, including damaged reputations, academic penalties, legal repercussions, or disqualification from projects or publications. To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to cite sources correctly using established citation styles like APA, MLA, or Chicago and to develop original ideas while using others' work only as a foundation or reference. Proper paraphrasing, summarizing, and quoting techniques, combined with a clear understanding of attribution, help maintain integrity and uphold ethical standards in writing and research.

        <p>All about Virus Malware and Anti-Virus</p>
        <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software designed to infect and damage a computer system. It attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and spreads when those files are executed or transferred. Once activated, a computer virus can perform harmful actions such as corrupting or deleting files, stealing sensitive information, or slowing down system performance. Some viruses replicate themselves, spreading across networks and infecting other devices. Unlike other types of malware, a virus requires a host file to function, and its primary goal is often to reproduce and spread, making it more difficult to detect and remove without proper antivirus software.</p>

        <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise the functionality of a computer system or network. It can come in various forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal personal information, damage files, disrupt operations, or give unauthorized access to attackers. It often spreads through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software. Protecting against malware involves using antivirus software, regularly updating systems, and practicing safe online habits such as avoiding suspicious links or downloads.</p>

      </div>
      <p>An antivirus is a software program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware), including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and other harmful programs from a computer or network. Antivirus programs work by scanning files, programs, and system activities for patterns or behaviors associated with known malware. They often provide real-time protection by continuously monitoring for threats, blocking suspicious activities, and alerting users to potential risks. Additionally, antivirus software is regularly updated to recognize new threats and ensure the system remains protected against emerging malware. It is an essential tool for maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems.</p>
